## Main Projects

### ExamExpert
A full-stack LMS I built for online exams. 
Front: React, Redux, React Query. 
Back: Node, Express, MongoDB.

### AceMrcem
A study platform for doctors preparing for the MRCEM exams. It has a complex content structure and a timed exam simulator.

The site exports to a static `out/` folder, so it works on GitHub Pages or any static host.
